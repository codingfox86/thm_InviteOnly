You are an SOC analyst on the SOC team at Managed Server Provider TrySecureMe. Today, you are supporting an L3 analyst in investigating flagged IPs, hashes, URLs, or domains as part of IR activities. One of the L1 analysts flagged two suspicious findings early in the morning and escalated them. Your task is to analyse these findings further and distil the information into usable threat intelligence. <br>

Flagged IP: 101[.]99[.]76[.]120<br>
Flagged SHA256 hash: 5d0509f68a9b7c415a726be75a078180e3f02e59866f193b0a99eee8e39c874f<br>

We recently purchased a new threat intelligence search application called TryDetectThis2.0. You can use this application to gather information on the indicators above.<br>

Connecting To The Machine<br>
Just start the Virtual Machine by clicking “Start Virtual Machine.” Once the VM is booted up, double-click the launcher on the desktop to start the TryDetectThis2.0 application.<br>

Ok folks, let's dive in and start their own [Virus Total Version](https://www.virustotal.com/) you see on the desktop of your VM and running on localhost. <br>
